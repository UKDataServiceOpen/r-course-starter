<exercise id="1" title="Sex and Religion">

During the second half of the twentieth century, sexuality has become a more common medium of intimacy outside of marriage. In this resource, we will explore real data to examine how attitudies towards sex relate to religion.

With sexuality institutionalized within marriage, sex outside of marriage was broadly condemned by society. However, with the secularization of society and sexual and contraceptive revolutions, the British public has mostly separated sexual intercourse and procreation. Views on sex, same-sex relationships, and traditional marriage have become increasingly liberal. Along with the advents of dating apps such as Tindr and the normalization of hook-up culture, attitudes towards casual sex are changing.

Religion, if important to an individual, can be a dominant influence on sexual behavior. For example, Christianity condemns promiscuity (casual sex) and teaches that sex should exclusively take place within marriage, as the purpose is to procreate. Many religious beliefs maintain that sex should serve gods will by deepening love between a married couple and for procreation. However, religious identity has fallen in recent decades (in 2018, 52% of Brits did not identify with a religion comaprd to 30 percent in 1983, according to the [British Social Attitudes survey](https://www.bsa.natcen.ac.uk/latest-report/british-social-attitudes-36/religion.aspx)).

Although most religions remain constant on their stances on sexual behaviors, the dramatic shifts in religiosity and public attitudes towards sex and casual sex leave scope for asking how much influence religious beliefs still have on an individualâ€™s attitudes towards sex without love.

<exercise id="2" title="Data">

## National Survey of Sexual Attitudes and Lifestyles
We will use data from the third, National Survey of Sexual Attitudes and Lifestyles (Natsal-3),

The British National Surveys of Sexual Attitudes and Lifestyles (Natsal) are some of the largest and most detailed studies of sexual attitudes and behavior in the world.

We are going to use a chunk of the data with information about attitudes towards sexual relationships, including sexual relationships without love, opinions on one night stands, whether people are under too much pressure to have sex.

## Data exploring

We can examine responses to the attitude questions and how they vary by characteristics such as religion and gender.

We will use some statistical tools including tables, bar charts, histograms and summary statistics such as mean and standard deviation.

Each will help us to understand the relationship between religion and attitudes towards sex.
